# 🍕 Pizza & Drinks Box – Frontend

A React application for displaying the menu, adding items to the cart, placing orders, and user authentication.

## 🚀 Technologies
- React 19.x  
- React Router DOM 7.x (for page routing and navigation)  
- Axios 1.x (for HTTP requests)  
- Vite 6.x (build tool and development server)  
- ESLint with React plugins (for code quality checks)  

## 📦 Running the Project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```


By default, the application runs locally on http://localhost with a port chosen by Vite (most often 5175).  
If the port is busy, Vite will automatically select another free port.
